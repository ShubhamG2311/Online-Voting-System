# Online Voting System

## Introduction
The existing voting systems face challenges related to security, transparency, and user authentication. This project aims to address these issues by implementing a secure online voting system using blockchain technology, ensuring a tamper-resistant and transparent electoral process. We have developed a web portal using Ethereum Blockchain Technology for solving this problem. We have included different features and levels of security to ensure security, transparency and avoid any types of attacks such as Phishing attacks and Smart Contract attacks. The App is almost completely decentralized while there is only admin with centralized access to administer the election. While we have worked on user-friendly experience and UI, our main focus relies on solving the security issues that exist in few online voting system such as OmniBallot, Voatz etc.

## Problem Statement
The blockchain is an emerging, decentralized, and distributed technology that promises to enhance different aspects of many industries. Expanding e-voting into blockchain technology could be the solution to alleviate the present concerns in e-voting. Generally speaking, following issues are most commonly faced in any traditional or e-voting system:
- Declining Voter Turnout
- Security and Fraud
- Privacy and Confidentiality
- Centralized Control
- Cost and Efficiency

## Features

### Security
- Ethereum Blockchain: Data stored on a secure, decentralized ledger, resistant to fraud and manipulation.
- Smart Contract: Controls voting process and data storage on the blockchain.
- Salt Hashing: Securely stores user passwords against data leaks.
- Manh modifiers: Secure access control for different users.
- 2-Factor Authentication (future): Facial recognition for stronger login security.

### Accessibility
- Metamask Wallet: Connects users to the Ethereum blockchain.
- Browser-based: Accessible on any device with a web browser.
- Multiple functionalities: Admin, voter, and candidate registration/login.
- User-friendly interface: ReactJS framework for smooth interaction.

### Voting Process
- Voter registration: Register with personal details and verification.
- Candidate registration: Register with details and voter ID validation.
- Secure voting: Cast vote through the smart contract on the blockchain.
- Results access: View election results once declared by the admin.

### Admin Control
- Open/close elections: Control election timeframe.
- Declare results: Publish final election results.

### Additional Features (working on)
- Facial recognition: More secure login through facial verification.
- Decentralized data storage: IPFS for storing large user data securely.
